## Sustainable

Sustainable is a project with the aim to collect, analyze and quantify fashion
brands and their supply chains. This includes many things such as product traceability,
factory news monitoring, material sustainability, etc.

What I hope to achieve is to quantify and continously monitor brands to
establish a guideline for the conscious shopper to easily reference.

Next steps:

- Create a automated job to periodically referesh the dataset and upload it to
  object store (S3 etc).

- Cross reference material with SAC Higgs MSI dataset and analyze each product's
  environmental impact.

- Web interface for user to quickly refrence and learn about a product and it's
  source, impact on environment etc.

- Expand to more transparent brands.
